The first couple of posts will be backdated. We are in our 3rd week but haven't posted because we didn't know what to call the name of our team or project.
 
### Plans ðŸ“†

*   ecurrencyhodler, Ron, and Moonboy to hop on a call and get to know one another and brainstorm ideas for the hackathon. Our meeting was on July 7th.
    

### Progress âœ…

*   We created a google sheet and started scoring ideas.
    

### Problems âœ‹

*   We didn't choose an idea yet because none really stuck out to us. We also might need a frontend developer.
    

### Links ðŸ”—

*   Here is the [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WP1VuDQA2vTBQawJORFOuXrarP-3hQyGErbPCKSQIpI/edit?usp=sharing) that shows the project ideas we brainstormed together and how we scored them under the tab "ideas". We also created a signal group to sync.
