# boltfun-ai
For the bolt.fun hackathon, hackers are challenged to revolutionize how we use Bitcoin and AI. Our project will contain two parts:
1. An incentivized crowd-sourced training model for LLMâ€™s using bitcoin. This will be the main focus of our project.
2. A user-facing bitcoin education platform as well as a method for people to crowdsource data.
